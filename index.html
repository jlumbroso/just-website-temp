		<h1> Mission </h1>
		<p style="font-style: italic"> Technology for a Just Society (JuST) is committed to empowering future technologists in creating a more just society. JuST offers a community where students can explore how technology can deepen social inequity, as well as how it can be leveraged to advance social justice and address other major societal challenges. </p>

		<h1> JuST Speaker Series </h1>
    <img class="wrap desktop" src="poster.png" width="40%" style="padding-left: 10vw; padding-top: 0px">

		<p> In Summer 2020, we look forward to welcoming a diverse set of speakers from academia, nonprofits, and the tech industry, to discuss the intersection of technology and social justice.</p>

		<p> Our first talk will be on Thursday, July 30th at 7:00 pm EDT. Professor Ethan Zuckerman, Director of the MIT Center for Civic Media, will join us in discussing the challenges of "innovating away" social problems. A short talk will be followed by a Q&A.</p>

    <p> In his <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/tech-and-other-peoples-problems/488297/">article</a> “The Perils of Using Technology to Solve Other People's Problems,” Zuckerman writes: "How do we help smart, well-meaning people address social problems in ways that make the world better, not worse?... Many hard problems require you to step back and consider whether you’re solving the right problem. If your solution only mitigates the symptoms of a deeper problem, you may be calcifying that problem and making it harder to change."</p>

    <div class="initiative">
    <h2> a more inclusive tech culture</h2>
    <p> We aim to promote inclusion within the Computer Science department and the greater Princeton STEM community, and elevate minority voices in tech.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="initiative">
    <h2> a space to innovate </h2>
    <p> 
      We will provide opportunities, such as mission-based hackathons, for students to apply technology towards advancing social justice. </p>
